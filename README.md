# Employee Leaving Prediction

This project aims to predict employee leaving (whether an employee will leave or not) using machine learning techniques. 

### Preface

The dataset includes various features such as age, education, experience, city, gender, and more. Multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forests, are trained and optimized to predict the **LeaveOrNot** target variable.

The project includes feature preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter optimization using Optuna, and meta-modeling to combine predictions from multiple models to enhance performance.
